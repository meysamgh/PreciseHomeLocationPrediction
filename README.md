# PreciseHomeLocationPrediction
Identifying user's home location using deep learning and consensus model with high accuracy

To run this code you need to have Keras installed on your system and Python3.
Please first run the codes:
RegressionBatchNormalization.py
and
ClassificationBatchNormalization.py

And then run the:
CheckAccuracy.py

to calculate the accuracy in different cases.
Please note that the CheckAccuracy.py assumes that the whole dataset is tested and stored there and the results are based on 1268 users.
You can find the dataset that we used at:
